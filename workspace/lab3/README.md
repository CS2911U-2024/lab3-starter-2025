## Lab 3: Hardware Modeling and Mapping Exploration

Please run and complete all Jupyter notebooks in this lab.

## Part 1: In this part, we will explore how to use different dataflows in a sequential system. Answer all questions 1.0-1.8. It may be useful to review the YAML file format, as this is a general tool that can be useful to you in the future.

## Part 2: In this part, we will scale up to a more realistic full system. Answer questions 2.0 - 2.4.

## Part 3: In this part, we will use Timeloop to search the mapspace for good solutions. Answer questions 3.0-3.3
